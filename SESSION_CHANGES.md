# Intake Form System - Session Changes Documentation

## Date: 2025-08-01

## Overview
This document outlines all the changes made to the intake form system during this session, including bug fixes, feature implementations, and code improvements.

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. AI Chat Implementation for Form Collection
- Implemented a conversational AI interface to collect form data through natural dialogue
- AI asks questions one by one instead of all at once
- Uses Claude API only for determining project type and service type
- All other questions use simple logic without AI

### 2. Reference Websites Collection
- AI now asks for reference websites: "Do you have any reference websites you'd like to share?"
- After collecting websites, asks for descriptions: "For each website you mentioned, what do you like about them?"
- Stores websites and descriptions as arrays to match manual form format
- Displays each website with its description in form view

### 3. Color Code Conversion
- AI automatically converts color names to hex codes
- Supports extensive color mapping (red → #FF0000, blue → #0000FF, etc.)
- Accepts hex codes if provided directly
- Stores colors as array of hex codes matching manual form format

### 4. Form Field Additions
The AI chat now collects all fields that the manual form has:
- Reference websites with descriptions
- Branding materials question
- Content writing services question
- Maintenance needs question
- Additional comments
- Referral source

### 5. Auto-Submit Feature
- Form automatically submits after the last question is answered
- No need for users to click a separate submit button

### 6. Service Type Storage
- Service type is saved both in the AI conversation JSON and as a separate database column
- Ensures compatibility with dashboard queries and reporting

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Fixed "Can't cast Complex Object Type Struct to String" Error
- **Issue**: form-view.cfm was trying to output structs as strings
- **Solution**: Used serializeJSON() for complex data types

### 2. Fixed Reference ID Display
- **Issue**: Forms showing numeric IDs (33, 41) instead of 8-character reference IDs
- **Solution**: Ensured reference_id generation at multiple points in the workflow

### 3. Fixed Service Type Not Showing in Dashboard
- **Issue**: Service type wasn't displaying for AI-submitted forms
- **Solution**: Added fallback to check ai_conversation field when database column is empty

### 4. Fixed AI Asking Questions Multiple Times
- **Issue**: AI was repeating questions already answered
- **Solution**: Implemented proper state tracking and re-evaluation after processing input

### 5. Fixed Form Structure Errors
- **Issue**: Tag mismatch errors in form-view.cfm
- **Solution**: Properly structured reference websites section with correct tag nesting

## Code Security Improvements

### 1. Removed API Keys from Code
- Created configuration system using config/config.cfm
- Application.cfc now loads configuration dynamically
- API keys no longer hardcoded in repository

### 2. Added to .gitignore
- config/config.cfm
- debug-*.txt files
- Other sensitive files

## Data Structure

### AI Conversation Storage
```json
{
    "conversationHistory": [...],
    "projectInfo": {
        "project_type": "website",
        "service_type": "corporate_site",
        "basicInfo": {
            "first_name": "John",
            "last_name": "Doe",
            "email": "john@example.com",
            "phone": "123-456-7890",
            "company": "ACME Corp",
            "contact_method": "email",
            "website": "https://current-site.com"
        },
        "projectDetails": {
            "description": "Need a modern website",
            "target_audience": "Business professionals",
            "geographic_target": "USA",
            "timeline": "3_months",
            "budget": "10k_25k"
        },
        "designFeatures": {
            "style": "modern_minimal",
            "colors": ["#FF0000", "#0000FF", "#00FF00"],
            "features": ["contact_form", "gallery", "blog"]
        },
        "additionalInfo": {
            "reference_websites": ["https://example1.com", "https://example2.com"],
            "reference_descriptions": ["Clean design", "Good navigation"],
            "has_branding": "yes",
            "need_content_writing": "no",
            "need_maintenance": "yes",
            "additional_comments": "Looking forward to working with you",
            "referral_source": "google_search"
        }
    }
}
```

### Database Storage
- All fields from projectInfo are extracted and stored in appropriate database columns
- Arrays (colors, features, reference_websites) are stored as database arrays
- service_type is stored both in JSON and as a separate column for easy querying

## Testing Checklist
- [x] AI chat asks questions one by one
- [x] Reference websites collected with descriptions
- [x] Colors converted to hex codes
- [x] All form fields collected
- [x] Auto-submit works after last question
- [x] Forms display correctly in form-view.cfm
- [x] Service type shows in dashboard
- [x] Reference IDs display instead of numeric IDs

## Future Considerations
1. Consider adding more color mappings as needed
2. May want to add validation for website URLs
3. Could enhance the AI responses for better user experience
4. Consider adding progress indicator for long forms
